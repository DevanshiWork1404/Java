# Building Calculator

## Overview
This project is a simple **Building Calculator** developed in Java.  
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to support quick calculations related to building.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- User input validation
- Simple console-based UI (or GUI if implemented)
- Supports custom test cases

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac Task1.java
## Using the Switch command to build a calculator
I implemented the calculator using a switch-case structure in Java.
Each case corresponds to one arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /).
The default case handles invalid operators, and division is checked to avoid dividing by zero.
This makes the program structured, readable, and easy to extend if new operations are added in the future.
